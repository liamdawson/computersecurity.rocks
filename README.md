# Computer Security Rocks

If you’re a computer user, this is for you. It gives you some advice on how to
approach computer security, with an aim to make the subject approachable and
actionable. You don’t need to be an expert to stay safe online!

If you're a developer or otherwise in the software industry, this is for you
too! When everyone improves their security standards, it makes support easier.
Feel free to contribute useful, actionable advice, or tweak the site to better
serve users of all kinds.

(If you're a designer, I'd _love_ your contributions)

## Development

Site is comprised of a small hand-written pipeline, building Pug into HTML, and
PostCSS into CSS. I’m open to pipeline changes **if** they do not introduce a
runtime dependency on JavaScript. Pipeline is contained in `build.js`.

`yarn dev` will run a server on `http://localhost:8080` and reload on changes.

Contributions welcome!

### Goals/TODOs
